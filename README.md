# Galaxy Network MAB

## What is "Galaxy Network MAB" ?

   Galaxy Network MAB is a Discord bot I've developed from the ground up.
   Galaxy Network MAB is commonly referred to "MAB", and MAB itself stands for
   "Moderation Assistant/Assistance Bot"
   While I'm fairly new to Javascript the bot has some incredible functionality.
   That being said, making bug reports is extremely helpful!
